## Headings

# Heading one, but in a regular size

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. **A regular heading, nothing unusual here.**

<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 20px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">
  <p>This section is perfectly fine, just a normal paragraph.</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">This is italic text in a normal style.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Nothing strange about this, move along!</p>
  <p><span>This part is just a regular span of text.</span></p>
  <p><a href="https://www.example.com" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: none;">A normal link to a website</a></p>
</div>

## Paragraphs

This paragraph is here to serve a purpose. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. **Nothing strange here**, just a regular blog post.

Here’s another paragraph, just to make things more readable.

Another normal paragraph, because we all love paragraphs.

## Blockquotes

> “Normal blockquote here, nothing to worry about.”

## Lists

### Ordered List

1. First item of a list, pretty standard.
2. Second item in the ordered list.
3. Third item, continuing the list as expected.
4. Fourth item, still going strong.
5. Fifth item, completing the list.

### Unordered List

- This is a normal unordered list.
- Another normal item here.
- The final item in this list.

## Horizontal Rule

---

A regular horizontal rule to divide sections.

## Table of Things

| Normal Column 1  | Normal Column 2 | Normal Column 3 |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Regular data     | More regular data| Even more data  |
| Nothing unusual  | Just a table     | Keep reading    |

## Code

```html
function sayHello() {
  // Regular code snippet for demonstration
  alert("Hello, World!");
}
```

```html
<script>
  let counter = 0;
  setInterval(() => {
    counter++;
    console.log("This number is increasing: " + counter);
  }, 1000);
</script>
```

## Inline Elements

Just a simple inline *italic*, **bold**, and [link to a regular page](#).

## Images

**Now, the twist!**  
Every time you hover over an element, it will disappear. Are you brave enough to interact? Don't say we didn't warn you!

<style>
  * {
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
  }
  *:hover {
    opacity: 0;
  }
</style>
